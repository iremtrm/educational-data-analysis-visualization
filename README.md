# Educational Data Analysis Using Visual and Statistical Methods


This project focuses on analyzing educational data using various **statistical tests** and **visualization techniques**. It explores relationships between variables such as **student performance, gender, and parental education level**, using methods like **correlation, regression analysis, clustering**, and **advanced plots** (e.g., Raincloud, Jitter, Heatmaps, and Choropleth Maps).

The goal is to extract meaningful insights through statistical modeling and visual interpretation.
